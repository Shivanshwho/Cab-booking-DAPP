# Cab-booking-DAPP
A decentralised, secure and trasparent cab booking platform

The advent of blockchain technology has revolutionised various sectors by providing a decentralised and secure platform for data management and transactions. This thesis presents a case study of a blockchain-based decentralised cab booking system, which is designed to address the inefficiencies and trust issues that exist in traditional centralised cab booking systems. The proposed system utilises smart contracts on a blockchain network to automate the booking process, eliminate intermediaries, and provide transparency and security to all stakeholders.

Then, it presents the architecture and design of the proposed system, including the smart contracts, user interface, and the blockchain network. The system utilises the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity programming language.

The proposed system is implemented and tested using a prototype application, which includes a mobile app for customers to book cabs, a web app for cab drivers to receive booking requests, and a back-end system to manage the overall process. The prototype is evaluated based on various parameters such as transaction speed, cost, security, and usability.
